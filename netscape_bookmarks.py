"""

"""Read bookmarks saved in a "Netscape bookmark" format
as exported by Microsoft Internet Explorer or Delicious.com (and
initially of course by Netscape).

Assumptions:
- The file is a Netscape bookmark file.
  See a doc at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753582%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
- There is only one record by line.
- If a decription/comment/note is attached to the bookmark, it is on
  a line prefixed with <DD> (and nothing else but the note should be
  on the same line).
